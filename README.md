## :warning: Important Setup Notes

* **Performance Stats:** Disable this setting if it's on.
* **Resolution:** Any is fine, auto resizes to 1920x1080 if too big of resolution. 
* **Roblox Sign-outs:** Sometimes Roblox logs you out of the app. Make sure your **default browser is logged into Roblox** to auto-login if needed.
* **Chat Detection:** The macro detects Vicious Bees through **Roblox chat**. If detection fails, switch your keyboard to **EN-US layout**.

## :question: Frequently Asked Questions

### :thought_balloon: Why does the macro join random games?

This is a **Roblox deeplink bug** — sometimes it sends you to other games. Nothing I can do to fix it.

---

### :thought_balloon: I'm getting "unknown status" or join errors?

It's likely a **Roblox API issue**. Using a VPN may reduce how often this happens.

---

### :thought_balloon: Why does the macro skip Spider and Clover fields?

This makes vicious hopping more efficient. The macro **will** go to Spider/Clover if a Vicious Bee is confirmed in those fields.

---

### :thought_balloon: The vicious bee takes too long to kill?

The macro is mainly for **mid-to-endgame** players farming **stingers** for Star Saw. If you're underleveled, especially in **Pepper Patch**, use **NatroMacro** instead or **Revolution Macro!**

---

### :thought_balloon: The pathing is breaking sometimes?

* Ensure **Move Speed is set correctly** (no haste).
* Avoid Roblox avatars with unusual hitboxes.
* **Lag** or poor performance can break pathfinding.
