# information
Bee swarm macro without searchers or passive alts. Only the main account server hops to find vicious bees.

**Performance stats** settings should also be turned **OFF** if you have it enabled and have the roblox chat enabled.

Resolution of 1920x1080 is the best resolution for the macro. The macro will not allow any higher resolutions and can be fixed by using rdp or changing display settings. 
 
Since Roblox sometimes signs you out of the roblox app, make sure your default browser is logged into roblox so it can log back into roblox again.

I would also recommend to switch your keyboard to en-us if you encounter vicious not being detected in the chat because the macro detects vicious bee through the roblox chat.

## Frequently Asked Questions

- Why does the macro join other games randomly?

Roblox sometimes throws you in a different game besides BSS for some reason which is a roblox deeplink issue unfortunately.  

- "Unknown status" or other join errors.

Seems to be a roblox api issue, using a vpn may help solve this issue.

- Why does the macro skip over spider and clover?

It makes vichopping faster and is overall more effective. The macro will go to spider and clover if there is ever a live vicious bee in those fields.

- Vicious taking too long to kill.

The macro is mainly intended for middle / end game players looking to grind stingers for star saw. The macro will strugle to kill pepper vicious bees if underleveled and recommend to just use NatroMacro to grind stingers.

-  Pathing sometimes breaking.

Make sure your movespeed is set correctly without any haste and avoid using roblox avatars that mess with the macro pathing. Having too much lag can also cause paths to break.
